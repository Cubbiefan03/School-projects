    <h2 align=center>Motovations For the Antartic</h2>
    <h3>Shackleton was originally wanting to cross the
      Antartic but he was stoped when his ship got traped
      in ice and they could only save food for 100 days.
      So they created maps for other people wanting to 
      explore the Antartic could gain know how to get
      around some parts and so they could add on and
      keep developing vaster and more detailed maps.
