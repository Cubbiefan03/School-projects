    <h2 align=center>Motovations For the Antartic</h2>
    <h3>Shackleton was originally wanting to cross the
      Antartic but he was stoped when his ship got traped
      in ice and they could only save food for 100 days.
      So they created maps for other people wanting to 
      explore the Antartic could gain know how to get
      around some parts and so they could add on and
      keep developing vaster and more detailed maps.

    <h3>
      Most of what Shackleton learned went unknown for a 
      long time due to Europe getting invoved in World War 
      One but more then anything he learned and 22 other
      men learned how to survive with nothing but what they
      had come with.

    <h2 align=center>Why Colonize In New/Unexplored Land</h2>
    
    <h3>
      Some positives of Colonizing in new land is that generaly
      land=power. Countries in Europe were wanting to gain
      power so they started to explore but with that they did
      not always realize what harm/change they have done throught the 
      spread of disesses and the slave trade. Along they way they also
      destroyed many acient cultures. An imbalence of power was also
      created in Europe. This time closely relates to Westward
      expansion in that their was disputes over land but it
      was not causing the destruction of other cultures and
