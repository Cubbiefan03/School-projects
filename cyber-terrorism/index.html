		hacking groups they have attempted to steal
		billions from other countries but have not
		gotten away with only millions. One of the

	<h3>Why Resort to<br>Cyber Terrorism</h3>
	<h4 align=left>
		North Korea is one of the most isolated countries
		in the World so you would think that they don't
		have the computer capabilities to cause that much
		damage but they still find ways to stay connected.
		The biggest reason they had to resort was their
		financial state. Thier first known attack was
		against a South Korean bannk which effected
		30 million customers and most of their accounts
		were frozen

	<h3>What is North Korea Getting</h3>
	<h4 align=right>
		North Korea is desprate for gaining power in the
		world they are wanting to show that they are still
		around and that there is no way of stopping them
		they are needing funding for their nuclear program.
		They have gotten what they want which is attention
		and hundreds of millions of dollars but they are still
		a massive threat to the rest of the world with them
		getting a lot of their funding from China. They have
		also gotten strict sanctions put on them as for what
		they have been doing.
