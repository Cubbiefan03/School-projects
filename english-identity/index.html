        I have always enjoyed technology and last year I really started to get into
        <br>
        cyber security and I started doing competitions this last spring I placed in
        <br>
        the top 8% or 429/5357 of high schoool and college students across the U.S.

      <h3 align=right width="50%">
        Along with my cyber security competitions I also enjoy networking which I
        <br>
        have been able to help people with and I am trying to get my Cisco
        <br>
        Certified CyberOps Associate before I graduate which will look good 
        <br>
        on internship and eventually job applacations.
